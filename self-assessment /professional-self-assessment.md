## Introduction

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and developing my ePortfolio helped me understand who I am as a computer science professional. My work across the program and in this capstone showed me that my strengths are secure software engineering, algorithmic problem solving, and structured database design. My time as a United States Navy Hospital Corpsman also influenced how I approach technology because I already work with sensitive health data, system readiness, and mission oriented communication.

This self-assessment introduces my professional abilities, values, and goals. It also explains how my artifact enhancements demonstrate the Computer Science program outcomes and how the artifacts work together in one complete portfolio.

## My Growth Through the Program and Capstone

The Computer Science program helped me build practical skills and confidence. In courses such as CS 260, CS 320, CS 340, CS 360, CS 370, CS 405, CS 465, and database-related courses, I learned how to design and secure full applications. The capstone asked me to revisit three major artifacts from earlier courses and improve them to meet professional quality.

- My **Travlr Getaways Web Application** represents software engineering and design.  
- My **Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt Game** represents algorithms and data structures.  
- My **Android Weight Tracking App** represents databases and secure storage.

Improving these artifacts helped me practice the same cycle used in real development work: review code, identify issues, add enhancements, and document the results clearly. This experience shaped my confidence as a future information security and software development professional.

## Collaborating in a Team Environment

Even though the capstone is individual work, my program as a whole taught me how to collaborate in computer science environments. I worked with classmates on shared exercises, peer feedback, and problem-solving. I learned how to accept input from others and refine my work while staying respectful and professional.

My Navy experience strengthened this skill even more. As a Hospital Corpsman and Radiation Health Technician, I regularly coordinate with medical officers, leadership, and junior personnel to ensure medical readiness. This helped me develop a team first mindset, attention to detail, and strong communication. These habits carried over naturally to code review, debugging, and technical discussions in this program.

## Communicating With Stakeholders

Throughout the capstone, I practiced communicating with different audiences. My code review video required me to explain existing functionality, outline weaknesses, and describe future enhancements in a way that would make sense to a manager or team lead. I practiced avoiding unnecessary jargon and focusing on the purpose of each change.

The narratives I wrote for my artifacts were also professional communication exercises. I explained why each artifact matters, what I improved, and how the work demonstrates my skills. This preparation will help me in future roles where I must document design choices, present solutions to leadership, or justify security decisions.

Clear communication is essential in information security and software engineering, and this capstone strengthened that skill for me.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

My artifact for this category is the **Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt Game**, where a pirate agent learns to navigate an eight-by-eight maze to reach a treasure. I used a neural network, experience replay, and reinforcement learning strategies such as epsilon greedy exploration.

Enhancing this artifact helped me apply algorithmic principles in several ways:

- I improved the epsilon decay process for better learning behavior.  
- I redesigned the replay memory structure for more efficient sampling.  
- I explained the time complexity of training loops, prediction steps, and replay sampling.  
- I added clear documentation to make the algorithm more understandable.

This work helped me meet the outcome related to designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles. It also prepared me for future work involving intelligent systems or automated decision tools.

## Software Engineering and Database Skills

My software engineering enhancement is represented by the **Travlr Getaways Web Application**, originally created in CS 465. I improved the architecture by adding secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens, clarifying the structure of routes and controllers, and refining the user interface. This showed that I can apply good design practices and use modern frameworks such as Angular and Node.

My database enhancement is represented by the **Weight Tracking Mobile App**, originally created in CS 360. I expanded it into a secure personal health application with:

- AES encryption for sensitive weight data  
- SHA 256 password hashing  
- A structured SQLite layer ready for future cloud sync  
- CSV export  
- A progress visualization chart using decrypted database values  
- A redesigned Material Design interface  

These changes demonstrate that I can protect user information, design clean database structures, and create secure mobile features. They also connect strongly to my interest in information security.

## Developing a Security Mindset

Security was a major theme in my capstone and forms a natural connection to my Navy experience, where I protect sensitive medical and radiation health data. Across my artifacts, I demonstrated a security mindset in several ways.

### In my Travlr Getaways project  
- Protected API routes  
- Improved session and token handling  
- Validated user inputs  
- Strengthened error responses  

### In my Weight Tracking App  
- Encrypted sensitive weight data  
- Hashed all user passwords  
- Improved database queries to reduce injection risks  
- Prepared the structure for safe future cloud integration  

### In my Deep Q Learning artifact  
I applied a different kind of security mindset by ensuring the agent learns stable and predictable behavior, which supports reliable automation.

Across all artifacts, I thought about vulnerabilities, design flaws, and safe data handling. This helped me meet the course outcome related to developing a strong security mindset.

## How My Artifacts Work Together

My three enhanced artifacts provide a full picture of my skills in computer science.

- **Software Engineering and Design:** Travlr Getaways Web Application  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures:** Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt  
- **Databases:** Weight Tracking Mobile App

Together, they show that I can design user interfaces, build full stack services, implement advanced algorithms, and secure data from the database level to the application level. They also reflect my long-term professional goals in software engineering and information security.

## Conclusion

My journey through the Computer Science program and this capstone helped me grow as a software professional. I now understand how software engineering, algorithms, databases, and security all connect. Enhancing my artifacts, writing narratives, and publishing my ePortfolio helped me clarify my strengths and professional direction.

I plan to use my ePortfolio to support applications for roles in secure software development and information security. I also plan to pursue certifications such as Security Plus to strengthen my skills further. The habits I built during this program, including secure coding, clear communication, and continuous improvement, will guide me as I continue my career.
