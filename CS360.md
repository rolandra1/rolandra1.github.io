# Weight Tracking App – Databases Enhancement  
CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming  
**Category:** Databases  

---

## Artifact Overview

The artifact I selected for the **databases** category is my **Weight Tracking App**, originally created in **CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming**. This Android Studio project allows users to register, log in, set weight goals, and record their daily progress.

In the original version, all data was stored in a simple **SQLite** database that used basic CRUD operations and a limited table structure. For the CS 499 capstone, I enhanced this artifact to meet modern expectations for **secure data storage**, **scalable database design**, and **user friendly mobile experience**.

These enhancements show my ability to manage user information securely, protect sensitive health data, and prepare the app for future cloud integration.

## Why I Selected This Artifact for My ePortfolio

I selected this artifact because it highlights my ability to **design, secure, and enhance** a mobile application that depends heavily on database operations. Database management is central to both **information security** and **software engineering**, which aligns with my long term professional goals.

The work in this enhancement demonstrates:

- Secure storage of sensitive health related values  
- A more structured and maintainable database layer  
- Better support for reporting, analytics, and future cloud sync  
- A clearer and more accessible user interface connected to database results  

Because the app combines secure data handling, database design, and mobile UI, it is a strong artifact for the **Databases** category in my ePortfolio.

## Key Enhancements in This Module

### 1. AES Encryption for Sensitive Data

I implemented **AES encryption** for weight entries and goal values before they are stored in SQLite. When the app reads the data back, it decrypts those values for display and charting.

This enhancement:

- Protects user health data at rest  
- Shows that I can apply encryption correctly around a database layer  
- Supports a security mindset where sensitive values are never stored in plain text

### 2. Secure Hashed Password Storage

In the original version, user passwords were stored in plain text. For the enhancement, I replaced this with **SHA 256 hashing** before saving credentials.

This change:

- Prevents direct exposure of user passwords in the database  
- Aligns the app more closely with real security practices  
- Supports Outcome Five by demonstrating a strong security mindset

### 3. Material Design UI Upgrade

I updated the layouts using **Material Design** principles. I improved:

- Spacing and alignment  
- Color contrast  
- Button styles and input fields  
- Clarity of messages and labels  

These changes make it easier for users to navigate database driven screens such as history, progress, and export.

    </p>

### 4. Structured Database Layer for Future Cloud Sync

Even though this module did not require **Firebase** or cloud sync, I prepared the architecture so that cloud integration can be added later without rewriting the app.

I did this by:

- Separating data logic into a clearer **database helper** and model classes  
- Creating a **WeightHistory** model to represent entries  
- Standardizing **encryption and decryption** methods in one place  
- Adding an **export to CSV** feature for backup and reporting  

These choices make it easier to connect the local SQLite layer to a future remote database, since the data access code is already organized and reusable.

    </p>

</div>

### 5. Enhanced Database Functions

I expanded the database features to give users more control and to support better analytics.

New or improved functions include:

- Weight history retrieval across all records  
- **Date range** query support  
- **CSV export** for offline backup or sharing with healthcare providers  
- More efficient **SQL queries** and reduced duplication  
- Cleaner and more organized **CRUD operations**  

These enhancements show that I can design a database layer that supports both day to day use and long term reporting.

---

### 6. Weight Progress Line Chart

I added a new visual feature using **MPAndroidChart**. The chart:

- Decrypts stored weight values  
- Sorts them by date  
- Plots them on a **line graph** so users can see their progress over time  

This enhancement demonstrates:

- Real use of database query results in the presentation layer  
- A correct flow of **decrypting before rendering**  
- Transformation of structured data into **meaningful visuals**  
- Practical data visualization skills in a mobile environment

## Alignment to Course Outcomes

In Module One of CS 499, I planned to target **Outcome Four** and **Outcome Five** with this database enhancement. The finished work supports both.

### Outcome Four  
**Demonstrate an ability to use well founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry specific goals.**

I demonstrated this outcome through:

- AES encryption for sensitive weight and goal data  
- SHA 256 password hashing  
- MPAndroidChart integration for data visualization  
- Structured SQLite data architecture  
- Export to CSV backup system  
- Material Design UI improvements tied directly to database content  

These show that I can use modern tools and secure design practices to upgrade an existing mobile system.

### Outcome Five  
**Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.**

I met this outcome by:

- Encrypting all sensitive weight and goal values before writing to the database  
- Hashing all user passwords rather than storing them in plain text  
- Validating user input to reduce invalid or dangerous data  
- Preventing direct exposure of internal database details in the UI  
- Designing SQL queries in a way that avoids injection risks  

These choices show that I approach mobile development with a security first mindset.

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process

Enhancing this artifact helped me deepen my understanding of **secure database design**, **encrypted data storage**, and **scalable architecture** for mobile apps.

I learned how encryption affects database queries and how to structure the app so that both local and future cloud databases can share similar models and logic. I also saw how database changes must stay in sync with the UI and the user experience, especially when users depend on accurate history and visual feedback to stay motivated.

One of the biggest challenges was making sure that encrypted values stayed usable for analytics and graph visualization. I had to carefully decrypt values in memory, transform them into chart entries, and still keep the database itself secure. Mapping these values into MPAndroidChart without breaking the rest of the workflow required careful testing.

I also learned how important **UI clarity** is when presenting database driven content. The progress chart, the improved tables, and the export feature gave users more confidence that their data is being tracked correctly and securely.

Through this enhancement, I strengthened my skills in **mobile development**, **database design**, and **secure data handling**. This artifact now reflects my readiness to build secure, data driven applications in real world environments and supports the database expertise expected in professional computer science work.
