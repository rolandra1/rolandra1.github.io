# Welcome

Welcome to my Computer Science ePortfolio. This portfolio represents my complete academic journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and reflects the skills, knowledge, and abilities I developed throughout the program. Each section highlights my professional growth, including secure software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database design.

My academic work is supported by real-world experience from my service as a United States Navy Hospital Corpsman, where I manage sensitive medical and radiation health data. This background strengthened my focus on secure system design, attention to detail, and long-term readiness — qualities that influence my approach to software development.

This ePortfolio demonstrates my learning through enhanced artifacts, a comprehensive self-assessment, and clear documentation of my development as a software professional.

# Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University was a transformative experience that shaped my professional identity. When I began this program, I envisioned myself primarily as an information security specialist. Through my coursework, hands-on projects, and capstone enhancements, I expanded my abilities into software engineering, database design, artificial intelligence, and secure system architecture.

I grew as a developer, communicator, and problem solver. My enhanced artifacts — the **Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application**, the **Deep Q-Learning Treasure Hunt**, and the **Android Weight Tracking App** — showcase the technical, algorithmic, and security-focused skills I developed.

My full, expanded self-assessment is available below:

  <em>“Code never lies. Comments sometimes do.”</em>
  <p style="text-align: right;">— Ron Jeffries</p>
</blockquote>

Throughout the Computer Science program, I completed courses that strengthened my understanding of programming, secure software development, mobile applications, artificial intelligence, and database systems. Courses such as **CS360 (Mobile Architecture)**, **CS370 (Artificial Intelligence)**, and **CS465 (Full Stack Development)** were especially influential in my development, both technically and professionally.

These courses helped me build the artifacts selected for my capstone enhancement:

- **CS465 – Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application** (Software Engineering & Design)  
- **CS370 – Deep Q-Learning Treasure Hunt** (Algorithms & Data Structures)  
- **CS360 – Android Weight Tracking App** (Databases & Security)

Together, these artifacts form a strong technical portfolio that demonstrates my experience in full-stack development, artificial intelligence, secure storage, and mobile engineering.

# Refinement Plan and Code Review

Code reviews played an essential role in evaluating existing functionality, identifying weaknesses, and planning enhancements for each artifact. Code review improves quality, maintains standards, and strengthens collaboration—skills that align directly with industry expectations.

In my capstone, I performed a full code review for:

- The Travlr Getaways website  
- The Deep Q-Learning Treasure Hunt  
- The Android Weight Tracking App  

These reviews helped me refine the structure, security, performance, and maintainability of each system.
