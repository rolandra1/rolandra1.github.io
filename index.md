## Overview

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio created for the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone at Southern New Hampshire University. This portfolio presents my growth as a computer science student through enhanced artifacts in:

- Software Engineering and Design  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Databases  

Each artifact includes its original form, the enhanced version, and a written narrative explaining the improvement process and the course outcomes demonstrated.

This ePortfolio also includes my professional self-assessment, which serves as an introduction to my skills, values, and career direction in information security and secure software development.

## 🔹 Code Review Video  
I performed a code review of all three artifacts early in the project.  
The video explains the original functionality, limitations, and my enhancement plan.
