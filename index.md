## Welcome and Overview

My ePortfolio represents the final stage of my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and serves as my formal introduction to the field as a professional. It brings together my major enhanced artifacts, my reflections, and my growth as a student and as a United States Navy Hospital Corpsman.

When I started this program, I mainly saw myself as a future information security specialist. Over time, through projects in web development, artificial intelligence, and mobile applications, I grew into a more complete software professional with strengths in secure software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database design. This self-assessment explains how my coursework and ePortfolio helped me develop these strengths, how I work with others, how I communicate with different stakeholders, and how my artifacts fit together to show that I have met the Computer Science program outcomes.

## Academic and Professional Background

I completed my Computer Science coursework while serving on active duty as a United States Navy Hospital Corpsman, working in radiation health and medical readiness. In my Navy role I handle sensitive medical and radiation health data, coordinate inspections, and support the readiness of sailors and ships. This environment demands accuracy, attention to detail, and a strong sense of responsibility.

The Computer Science program added a new dimension to my professional identity. Courses such as CS 260 Data Structures and Algorithms, CS 320 Software Testing, CS 340 Advanced Programming Concepts, CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming, CS 370 Artificial Intelligence, CS 405 Secure Coding, and CS 465 Full Stack Development I gave me a structured path from basic programming to advanced software solutions. My journals and milestone reflections across modules helped me connect what I was learning in class to the standards and discipline I already used in the Navy.

The capstone brought all of this together. It required me to select past projects, perform a code review, design enhancements, and publish everything in a professional ePortfolio that someone outside the classroom can actually use to understand my skills.

## Growth Through Coursework and the Capstone

Throughout the program I moved from writing small single purpose programs to building complete systems with multiple layers. I learned how to design and evaluate computing solutions, work with databases, test my code, and think about security from the beginning of a project instead of treating it as an add on.

For the capstone I returned to three major artifacts and enhanced them:

* **Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application** from CS 465  
  Represents the software engineering and design category.  
  [Link to CS465 artifact page](../CS465)

* **Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt project** from CS 370  
  Represents the algorithms and data structures category.  
  [Link to CS370 artifact page](../CS370)

* **Android Weight Tracking App** from CS 360  
  Represents the databases and secure data handling category.  
  [Link to CS360 artifact page](../CS360)

From my earlier journals and milestone submissions, I used my instructor feedback to refine these artifacts so they match program outcomes and look like something I could show to a hiring manager.

## Collaboration and Team Environments

Even though the capstone is an individual project, my experience in this program and in the Navy has been built around collaboration.

In my courses I worked with classmates through discussion boards, peer responses, and group oriented problem solving. These experiences taught me how to:

* Explain why I chose a specific design or algorithm.  
* Accept feedback without taking it personally.  
* Adjust my code and documentation based on suggestions from others.  

In my Navy duties I work with medical officers, department heads, and junior sailors to maintain radiation health programs and medical readiness. We coordinate inspections, audits, and drills. I often have to translate policy into clear action steps and track completion. That same pattern shows up in software projects through code reviews, sprint planning, and issue tracking.

During the capstone, I treated my instructor as my primary project stakeholder. Each milestone submission felt like a review meeting where I presented my current work, received comments, and then applied that feedback to improve structure, security, and clarity in my code and narratives. This mirrors real development cycles in collaborative environments.

## Communication With Stakeholders

The capstone required several forms of communication that reflect real project life.

* **Code review video:** I created a walkthrough of my original artifacts, explained what they did, pointed out weaknesses, and described my enhancement plan. I had to speak slowly, avoid unnecessary jargon, and keep the focus on why my changes mattered.  
* **Milestone narratives and journals:** For each artifact I wrote about what the project is, what I changed, what I learned, and how the enhancements align with the five program outcomes.  
* **This professional self assessment:** This document functions as an introduction to me and my work for an audience that includes instructors, recruiters, and future managers.

Across all of these, I practiced adapting my message to the audience. For example, when describing my Deep Q Learning work, I used technical terms like exploration rate and replay memory, but I explained them in simple language so someone with limited AI knowledge could still follow the logic.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

The algorithms and data structures category in my ePortfolio is represented by my **Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt** project from CS 370.

In this project a reinforcement learning agent explores an eight by eight maze in search of a treasure. To enhance this artifact for the capstone, I:

* Refined the **epsilon greedy strategy** so that exploration and exploitation are better balanced.  
* Used a **replay buffer** with queue like behavior to store past experiences and sample mini batches during training.  
* Analyzed the **time complexity** of the training loop, including the cost of predicting Q values and updating weights.  
* Documented how parameter choices, such as learning rate and discount factor, affect stability and performance.  

These enhancements show my ability to design algorithmic solutions, understand data structures that support them, and explain the trade offs involved. It is not just that the model trains and wins more often. I can describe why the changes work and how they align with reinforcement learning theory.

## Software Engineering and Databases

### Software Engineering – Travlr Getaways (CS 465)

For the software engineering and design category, I enhanced my **Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application**, which began in CS 465.

In the capstone version, I:

* Improved the project structure to separate routes, controllers, views, and models more clearly.  
* Integrated **JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication** so that protected resources are not accessible without proper login.  
* Cleaned up the **user interface** so it follows more consistent layout and navigation patterns.  
* Thought carefully about error handling and the messages users see when something fails.  

These changes show that I can work with a real web application that uses Node, Express, and templating or front end components. I understand how to improve code that already exists instead of always starting over. This is an important skill in the software industry.

### Databases – Android Weight Tracking App (CS 360)

For the databases category, I enhanced my **Android Weight Tracking App**.

In the enhanced version, I:

* Used **SQLite** with a more structured schema that clearly separates users, goals, and weight entries.  
* Implemented **AES encryption** for sensitive stored data so that someone who accesses the device storage cannot easily read raw values.  
* Stored passwords using **hashing** rather than plain text to better protect user accounts.  
* Added **CSV export** and a **visual progress chart** to turn raw data into useful information for the user.  

These enhancements align directly with database outcome expectations and show that I can design data storage that is both practical and security aware on a mobile platform.

## Security Mindset

Security is the theme that connects all of my artifacts and my professional background.

* In **Travlr Getaways**, I treated authentication and authorization as core parts of the design, not add ons. I considered input validation, token handling, and what happens if an unauthorized user tries to reach a protected route.  
* In the **Weight Tracking App**, I treated weight history as health related data that deserves strong protection. Encryption, hashing, and careful database access help address that.  
* In my **AI work**, I practiced disciplined thinking about stability and correctness. While this is not direct security work, the same mindset is needed when you build systems that may one day make automated decisions in a security context.

My Navy work built this mindset before I ever wrote code. Working with radiation health exams, dosimetry, and medical records taught me that data is never just numbers. It belongs to real people. That sense of responsibility now shows up in how I design and review software systems.

## How the Artifacts Fit Together

My three capstone artifacts form one consistent story about who I am as a computer science professional.

* **Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application**  
  Shows that I can design and improve software architecture, manage routing and views, and integrate secure authentication.  

* **Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt**  
  Shows that I understand data structures, algorithms, and reinforcement learning. I can reason about performance, convergence, and parameter trade offs.  

* **Android Weight Tracking App**  
  Shows that I can design a secure, database driven mobile application with encryption, hashing, and clear user feedback.

Together these artifacts show that I:

* Work across different platforms, including web and mobile.  
* Understand both traditional algorithms and machine learning techniques.  
* Treat data security and privacy as design requirements.  
* Can explain my work in a way that others can understand, through both code and narrative.
