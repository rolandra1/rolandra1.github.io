## Welcome

My CS 499 ePortfolio represents my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and my growth as a developing computer science professional. It brings together my strongest work in software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases, along with my mindset as an information security focused student and active duty United States Navy Hospital Corpsman.

Throughout the program I learned to design, build, test, and secure real applications. This site organizes my capstone enhancements and shows how I now think like a professional who must balance technical quality, security, user experience, and teamwork. The artifacts on each page connect directly to the CS 499 outcomes and are ready to share with both academic evaluators and future employers.

## Professional Self Assessment

My Professional Self Assessment explains how my coursework, my capstone enhancements, and my Navy experience work together to shape me as a computer science professional with a strong security mindset. It also describes how my three main artifacts meet all CS 499 outcomes and how they connect to my long term goals in secure software development and information security.

### Portfolio Overview {#portfolio-overview}

Across the Computer Science program I completed courses such as CS 260, CS 320, CS 340, CS 360, CS 370, CS 405, CS 465, and database focused work. For the capstone I selected three artifacts to enhance and feature:

- **CS 465 Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application**  
- **CS 370 Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt**  
- **CS 360 Android Weight Tracking App**

Each artifact has its own page with a detailed narrative, screenshots, and explanation of which outcomes it satisfies:

- [CS 465 Artifact Page – Travlr Getaways](CS465)  
- [CS 370 Artifact Page – Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt](CS370)  
- [CS 360 Artifact Page – Weight Tracking App](CS360)  

Together these projects show that I can design secure systems end to end, apply algorithmic thinking, and manage data safely in mobile and web environments.

### Preparing for My Future Career {#preparing-for-my-future-career}

My long term goal is to move into roles that combine secure software development and information security. I plan to use this ePortfolio when I apply for positions that involve secure web development, mobile applications with protected data, or security focused engineering roles. I also plan to pursue certifications such as CompTIA Security plus to complement this degree.

This ePortfolio gives employers a single place where they can see my code, my technical explanations, and my ability to communicate clearly with different audiences.

## Refinement Plan and Code Review {#codereview}

For CS 499 I completed a formal code review that covered all three artifacts. In that review I walked through the original code, identified weaknesses, and explained my enhancement plan for:

- The **Travlr Getaways** full stack site  
- The **Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt** project  
- The **Android Weight Tracking App**

The review focused on quality, maintainability, security, and user experience. It also showed that I can use professional communication skills to describe complex code to a technical or semi technical audience.

## Software Engineering and Design {#softwaredesign}

### Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application {#travlr-getaways}

My software engineering and design artifact is the **Travlr Getaways** full stack travel site from CS 465. In the capstone I enhanced this project by improving the architecture, adding secure authentication, and separating responsibilities between the client and server more cleanly.

Key ideas include:

- Node and Express for the server with clear route structure  
- An Angular front end prepared for single page application behavior  
- JSON Web Token authentication and protected routes  
- Better error handling and input validation  
- A design that is easier to maintain and extend

These changes show that I can follow a software development life cycle, think about architecture, and implement real features that match user and business needs.

## Algorithms and Data Structures {#algorithms}

### Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt {#deep-q-learning}

My algorithms and data structures artifact is the **Deep Q Learning Treasure Hunt** project from CS 370. In this project an agent plays the role of a pirate in an eight by eight maze and learns to reach the treasure using reinforcement learning with a neural network.

In my enhancement work I:

- Refined the `qtrain` function and training loop  
- Used an epsilon greedy policy with adjustable exploration rate  
- Implemented an experience replay buffer that acts like a bounded queue  
- Analyzed the approximate time complexity for training and mini batch updates  
- Logged metrics such as win rate and loss to evaluate performance

This artifact shows that I can use algorithmic principles to build and evaluate computing solutions, not only at the level of individual functions but also at the level of a learning system that makes decisions over many steps.

## Databases {#databases}

### Android Weight Tracking App {#weight-tracking-app}

My databases artifact is the **Android Weight Tracking App** from CS 360. The original app used a simple SQLite structure. For the capstone I enhanced it to behave more like a secure, real world health application.

Enhancements include:

- A more structured SQLite schema with clear tables and relationships  
- AES encryption for sensitive weight entries stored on the device  
- Secure password handling with hashing rather than plain text storage  
- An export to CSV feature so users can back up or share their data  
- A progress chart that reads from the encrypted data and shows trends visually

This project demonstrates that I can design and implement secure data storage for a mobile app and that I understand how database decisions affect user experience, security, and future cloud integration.
